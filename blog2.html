Boost in Standard Deduction

Taxpayers are eagerly anticipating some relief in income tax, with a possible increase in the standard deduction. Last revised in 2019, experts speculate that an amendment might propose applying the standard deduction as a percentage of an individualâ€™s salary income, ensuring fair benefits for all employed individuals.
HRA Expansion to Bangalore and Hyderabad

Employers commonly include House Rent Allowance (HRA) in employees' compensation packages. If an employee receiving HRA is paying rent for their residence, they can claim a tax exemption on this allowance.

Currently, rented houses in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai are eligible for a 50% exemption from HRA, while those in other locations fall under the 40% bracket. It's noteworthy that this classification was established over three decades ago.

Over time, cities have experienced significant demographic and economic growth, prompting the need to reassess the classification of metro and non-metro cities.

There is a growing demand to extend the 50% limit for House Rent Allowance (HRA) to cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad, considering their current high cost of living. While this higher limit currently applies to metro cities such as Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, its expansion could offer financial relief to individuals residing in other high-cost cities.
